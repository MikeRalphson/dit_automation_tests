Feature: Postcode service
  In order to geo-block content from outside the UK
  As ITV
  I want to set-up regionalisation via postcode

  Scenario Outline: Verify that the correct broadcaster value is returned
    Given I request the postcode service with <postcode>
    Then I should receive the correct <broadcaster>
    And the response should contain the "Access-Control-Allow-Origin" header

  Examples:
    | postcode | broadcaster |
    | W6 9SW   | ITV         |
    | G51 1DA  | STV         |
    | BT15 1ED | UTV         |
    | CF24 0ED | ITV         |
    | JE2 3GF  | Channel     |

  Scenario Outline: Verify that the correct broadcaster value is returned for partial postcodes
    Given I request the postcode service using a partial <postcode>
    Then I should receive the correct <broadcaster>
    And the response should contain the "Access-Control-Allow-Origin" header

  Examples:
    | postcode | broadcaster |
    | BB11     | ITV         |
    | NW10     | ITV         |
    | DG11     | ITV         |
    | DD11     | STV         |

    | BT11     | UTV         |
    | BT15     | UTV         |
