Feature: YouView Broadcaster lookup service
  In order to map a YouView region to an ITV Broadcaster
  As a YouView client
  I want to be able to use a lookup service to do the mapping

  Scenario Outline: Lookup Broadcaster for a YouView region
    When I make a YouView Broadcaster Lookup request for <region>
    Then the response should contain <broadcaster> broadcaster

  Examples:
