Feature: Broadcaster API feeds
  In order to validate the correct broadcasts
  As a backend enabler
  I must ensure the appropriate broadcasts are transmitted per region

  Scenario Outline: DN-221 Verify that the correct urls are available for a certain broadcaster for Android
    Given I request the master feed for <platform> and <broadcaster>
    Then the master feed should contain the expected <links> for the requested broadcaster

  Examples:
    | broadcaster | platform | links                     |
    | itv         | android  | Episode/Crucial           |
